Setting & Arrival

Location: Eleanor castle, stone halls with mycelial threads and black spines
Simeon arrives wearing Eleanor noble colors despite being identified as a monk and slave
Anne accompanies him but is denied entry as a servant
Guard initially challenges them but allows Simeon through once he identifies himself

The Court Assembly

Simeon enters an empty courtroom but finds voices coming from a back room
Present nobles: Elizabeth, an old hunched man (Lord Eleanor), a child in princely costume (later revealed as Morganne), Alfred, a burly nobleman, and a Woodward-clone gentleman

The Economic/Military Debate
Two major factions arguing:

Burly nobleman: Concerned about laborers unable to repair/replace furniture and roofs; complaints about carapace shortages, paper shortages, and monopolistic pricing practices (Gestods getting better prices than his guild)
Alfred & Woodward-clone: Focused on killing a massive beast threatening the city; Alfred's hunting parties are dying; his father leads the hunt from a cold tent

The argument escalates with personal attacks about Alfred's wife and his father's temperament.
Lady Eleanor's Intervention

Lord Eleanor whispers something to Lady Eleanor after glancing at Simeon
She announces a new urgent problem: a smuggled synapsid killed by an unknown weapon, potential elvish involvement
She gives Simeon the floor to speak

Simeon's Revelations
First Revelation: His Identity

Confirms he is both monk and traitor to House Eleanor
Admits he leaked "the princess's secret" - the source of Lady Eleanor's previous troubles
Warns of "death within our walls" and accuses Lady Eleanor of lies

Second Revelation: The Prince's True Identity

Declares the sitting prince is actually a girl
Identifies her as Morganne Eleanor, daughter of Corrinne Lancaster (Simeon's half-sister)
The child had been silent throughout the meeting

The Dramatic Proof

Simeon approaches Morganne despite Lady Eleanor's protests
Removes her collar, revealing a black ribbon with a scarlet jewel
When he touches the gem, it melts into scarlet liquid (magical silencing device)
Morganne immediately begins speaking once freed
She confirms she's a girl who wants to be "like mom or Bonnie" but her mother forces her to pretend to be a boy

Supernatural Climax
While the room erupts in chaos:

Simeon notices mycelial strands on the wall splitting apart, cleaved by an invisible force
A white chord travels along cracks in the rock
He sees through a window: a wraith moving through the city streets toward the castle
He feels an "echo crawl up his spine" - suggesting a mystical connection
Simeon mutters about "something happening" but is grabbed and shoved against the wall by a guard
Lady Eleanor glares at him, described as having her "fire long gone out"
