Lady Eleanor,

I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't know this would happen. I'll do anything to make this right, I swear. I begged to be Lord Gorfeld's footstool. Please, don't hate me.

Jonah,

Lady Eleanor,

I don't know if you receive my letters, the priest at the cathedral says he delivers them. I purchased a shirt today. Alfred lets me collect sprie limbs so I can sell them at the market, but the only one who'll buy them rips me off. 

Alfred is so mad. He yelled at the priest this last excursion, even though we all rely on him for air. I'm so sorry. I didn't know you meant so much to him. ~~I wish~~ I will make this better.

Dearest Cynthia Eleanor,

The church refuses all reason. I have pleaded with the bishop, even threatened armed conflict, but they have rebuffed every petition, and called every bluff. Why, why did it have to be a son? If it were a daughter, the church would have no choice but to release you. I curse the church and their indecipherable rules. To lock up such a noble soul as your own is a crime beyond compare. I am in constant communication with the Lady Eleanor, and we work tirelessly for your release.

Always your servant,

Alfred Gorfeld

Your servant Jonah clings to me like a foul moss. I wish you were here to control his outbursts.

Dear Lady Eleanor,

I bought a pair of shoes. It is the happiest day since leaving your service. I can finally keep up with the soldiers, and don't have to look for moss outcroppings. I fought a sprie, stabbed it in the leg. It kicked me so hard I thought I died, but I saved Brian. He's one of Alfred's soldiers. Alfred is working so hard, and I'm starting to see why you chose him. I will make this better, somehow.

Dear Lady Eleanor,

I thought I'd never be able to write to you again. We were protecting the Stipejacks when we were attacked by sprie. I did my best to hold the line, and stabbed one, but it took my hand. I thought it was gone, and that I wouldn't be able to hold a brush or a sword again. But Brian picked it up and Alfred let him run me back to the cathedral. I was so scared. It still burns, like it's not really there when I flex it. It's fine though. If I die trying to free you, I only want you to not hate me.

Dearest Cynthia, 

I fear we have exhausted every avenue with the church. A son is ready to be named king, and so the church remains stagnant. Now my own parents vex me. I did not wish for this, Jonah does not wish for this. I curse that fateful night. How I wish you had never learned to sing. I wish even to be at your side, but I fear the maiden has long abandoned our contract. Be happy Cynthia, I will write again soon.

Dear Lady Eleanor,

Alfred has cancelled our last three hunts. I don't know what has happened, but he has stopped fighting with the priest about you. I will ask him during our fencing lessons, maybe something changed. Or hopefully he has a plan to break you free. 

My words are only yours.

Dear Lady Eleanor,

I saw Simeon at the monastary today. I couldn't approach him, so I hope you have the opportunity to tell him sorry for me. Sorry I messed up, and for kicking him in the face. My words are only for you, but I haven't heard anything from my mom since leaving your service. ~~I wish I could~~ I just want to hear from them, and how the baby is doing. Please, don't give up ~~Cyn~~ Lady Eleanor. Even if everyone else abandons you I'll find a way.

My words are only yours,

Jonah

That spriesucker married Fionna. If I could, I'd strangle Alfred and leave him for dead. How could he do this to you? How could he go with the whore that ruined the life of the woman he loved. I don't get it. I don't understand any of this nobility stuff. He abandoned you and acts like it was nothing. My dagger screams in my belt, but he is nobility, and I'm a simple man-at-arms, in his service, and not even yours. I hate this.

My words are only yours,

Jonah

Add.

This is to ~~Cynth~~ Lady Eleanor.

 Sixthsday of the Southerly Waning Crescent of the fifty eighth year of our King, Lord Charles Eleanor the 18th.

Dear Lady Eleanor,

I finally confronted Simeon. He was afraid for a moment, when I wouldn't talk to him, but I think we came to some terms. He talked a lot about the church, and how wonderful the singing was, but the only thing he mentioned about you was that he couldn't see you, even though you're in the same building. I don't understand any of these rules, or why everyone is so scared of angering a bunch of unarmed priests. Apparently he spends most of the day reading and copying books, which seems like something he'd like. He says the best part is the singing though, even if its only the one song over and over. He says there's more, but he's not allowed to talk about them. Even tried to convince me to join the church. I would never. My loyalty is only to you Lady Eleanor. Not to your abductors.

My words are only yours,

Jonah

Dear Lady Eleanor, 

Alfred is expecting a second child now. He made a joke with the priest about calling her Cynthia. I couldn't stand to be near him for the rest of the day. I admire him, as a leader, and as a fighter, but even after all this time, to treat you so callously made me sick. This one is a little short. I'm just feeling a little lost.

My words are only yours, 

Jonah



Firstsday of the Northerly Waxing Crescent of the Sixty-first year of our King, Lord Charles Eleanor the 18th.

Dear Lady Eleanor,

We're back on the trail of that basilisk that spooked us so badly eight years ago. Alfred is calling up the reserves and his father is claiming that this is his retirement hunt. Alfred will finally be lord of the Gorfled household. He'll have a kingly celebration for all if we can kill it. It's dangerous, but know I'm doing this for you.

My words are only yours,

Jonah

Fifthsday of the Easterly waning crescent of the fifty third year of our King, Lord Charles Eleanor the 18th.

Dear Cynthia,

As we both are aware, the church is immanently unreasonable and is unlikely to hand you over if we have a son on the throne, though I wish that was the case. Our — indiscretion — about the child was only to buy enough time and stability that we might negotiate your release. However, our attempts have failed, and now with a publicly male heir we risk destabilizing the entire kingdom if we retract our statement. Time, we have bought, but too much time, and with no return. 

So, regrettably, you will stay with the church for the time being, until our attempts are successful, or the secret, and scandal is discovered. Do not take this harshly, dear Cynthia, we gambled and lost, and now you and I pay the price. I know I cannot make this better, and that you will hate me for the rest of my life, but I am sorry. It was a mistake to send you to the boarding school, and I would take it back if I could. I can't, however. I will stay in regular correspondence, in case we find some escape or crisis I can manufacture that will secure your early release.

with great regret,

Lady Elizabeth Eleanor

Seventhsday of the Southerly waning crescent of the fifty-fourth year of our King, Lord Charles Eleanor the 18th.

Dear Cynthia,

Your father has placed his personal guard around the whore and the bastard. 

 I am sorry, 
 
Lady Elizabeth Eleanor
