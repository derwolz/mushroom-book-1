Based on my reading of this chapter, here's a comprehensive event list:
Opening Journey/Expedition

    Jonah travels through dangerous spore-filled terrain with an expedition led by Alfred
    The group carries sprie limbs and equipment while avoiding deadly spores
    Alfred treats Jonah harshly, using him as a footrest and servant
    A priest accompanies the group and argues with Alfred about Jonah's treatment
    Alfred mentions this expedition is Jonah's only chance to "wield a sword again" and references Jonah's brother

First Battle at the Nest

    The expedition reaches a sprie nest in a cave
    They deploy fireballs on sleds to attack the nest entrance
    The priest ignites the fireballs with magic, causing an explosion
    Hundreds of sprielings emerge and attack the company
    A major battle ensues in near-darkness, lit only by the priest's red staff light
    Jonah hides during most of the fighting but saves a wounded soldier by stabbing a sprie with a found dagger
    The battle ends with many dead sprie and some human casualties

Return to the City

    Alfred gives Jonah the dagger as a reward from the fallen soldier Brian
    The expedition returns to the white-walled city of Elgoth
    Alfred dismisses Jonah upon arrival
    Brian attempts to thank Jonah but Alfred prevents it

Life in the City

    Jonah enters the marketplace to sell sprie legs
    He negotiates (through gestures, as he appears to be mute) with a merchant for 7 coins
    The merchant notices Jonah's valuable dagger and offers 200 coins, but Jonah refuses
    Jonah tries to buy shoes for 50 coins but only has 47
    The shoe merchant initially refuses but eventually gives him the shoes on credit
    Jonah returns to his shelter - a hovel with a sign identifying him as "Jonah Lancaster traitor to house Eleanor"

Visit to the Church

    Jonah writes a letter and takes it to a massive stone church
    He gives the letter to a black-robed priest who recognizes him
    Jonah attends a religious service where the priest leads worship of "the Maiden"
    A magical ceremony produces bread (manna) for all attendees
    Jonah eats alone after others leave, then returns to his shelter

Second Expedition/Battle

    Another expedition into sprie territory
    A major aerial battle occurs with flying sprie
    A large basilisk approaches the camp, causing the expedition to retreat to the "stipejacks" (workers harvesting mushroom stipes)
    The stipejacks are attacked by another wave of sprie
    During this battle, Jonah charges a large clawed creature with his makeshift spear
    Jonah is severely injured, losing his hand/wrist in the attack
    Brian kills the creature that wounded Jonah
    The chapter ends with Jonah badly wounded and in shock
